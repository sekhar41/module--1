            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
             Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
             a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. 
             In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes 
             
             a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).

              particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.
